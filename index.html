          <p>
            Programming is a way to “instruct the computer to perform various tasks to solve problems”.<br>
            without the programmer, the computer is useless. It does what you tell it to do. computers are
            tools. They are complex tools, but they are not mysterious or magical: they exist to make tasks
            easier.

          <p>
            Without software, modern computers are just complicated machines for turning electricity into heat.
            It’s software on your computer that runs your operating system, browser, email, games, movie player
            – just about everything.

        <div id="creativeProgramming">
          <h3><b>Programming is creative</b></h3>
          <p>
            Programming is a creative task: there is no right or wrong way to solve a problem, in the same way,
            that there is no right or wrong way to paint a picture. There are choices to be made, and one way
            may seem better than another, but that doesn’t mean the other is wrong! With the right skills and
            experience, a programmer can craft software to solve an unlimited number of problems – from telling
            you when your next train will arrive at playing your favourite music. The possibilities are
            constrained only by your imagination.

          <p>
            When you create a program for a computer, you give it a set of instructions, which it will run one at a
            time in order, precisely as given. If you told a computer to jump off a cliff, it would!

          <h3><b>Why should you bother about coding?!!</b></h3>
          <p>
            You must be wondering - why does one need a computer for adding or rounding off numbers? Or even for
            simple interest calculation? After all, even an 8th standard kid can easily do such things even over
            large numbers. What is programming used for? What benefits do computers offer? <b>Well, computers
              offer so many benefits:</b>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <i>Computers are fast:</i> computers are amazingly fast. If you know how to properly utilize the
              power of Computer programming, you can do wonders with it. For a typical computer of today’s
              time, an addition of 2 numbers which could be as big as a billion each takes hardly a
              nanosecond. Read again - nanosecond! That means that in 1 second, a computer can perform about a
              billion additions. Can any human ever do that? Forget a billion additions a second, typical
              human can’t even do 10 additions per second. So, computers offer great speed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Computers are cheap:</i> if you were a stock market analyst and you had to monitor the data
              of say 1000 stocks so that you can quickly trade them. Imagine the hassle that would create if
              you were to do it manually! It is just impractical. While you are performing your calculation on
              the stock’s performance, the price may change. The other alternative is to hire people so that
              you can monitor more stocks in parallel. That means your cost goes up significantly. Not to
              mention the trouble you will face if some of your employees commit a calculation error in the
              process. You may end up losing money! Contrast that with the case where you use a computer.
              Computers can process a huge amount of information quickly and reliably. 1000 stocks are nothing
              for computers in the 21st century.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Computers can work 24x7:</i> Computers can work 24x7 without getting exhausted. So, if you
              have a task that is big enough, you can without worries allocate it to a computer by programming
              it and sleep peacefully.

            Unfortunately, computers don’t understand languages like English or Spanish, so we have to use a
            programming
            language they understand to give them instructions. There are many different programming languages,
            all of which
            have their own merits, and certain languages are better suited to particular types of tasks, <b>but
              there is no
              one language that is the ‘best’</b>. <br>
            Computers understand instructions that are written in a specific syntactical form called a
            programming language.
            A programming language provides a way for a programmer to express a task so that it could be
            understood and
            executed by a computer. It made of many tiny switches that can be either on or off. When a switch is
            on, it is represented by a 1. When it is off, it is represented by a 0. These 1s and 0s are called
            bits. Bits are the fundamental language of nearly all computers and every program must be translated
            into bits before it can be executed by the computer.<br>
            When 8 bits are grouped together, this is called a byte. A byte can represent a letter, for example,
            01100001 represents 'a'. A byte can also represent a control character. For example, 00000011
            signals the end of a piece of text. When representing a number using bits, it can be converted from
            its normal base 10 representation to binary. This is called binary representation.

Sometimes, programmers will develop programs directly with machine code, but because this is difficult to understand and tedious to type, it is more common to program using assembly or a high-level language.</td>
                <td>The bits of machine language are replaced by numbers and English commands. Before assembly code is run by the computer, it is assembled by an assembler. This converts the code back into the 1s and 0s of machine language that the computer can understand.</td>
                <td>Many high-level languages have built-in commands that help the programmer write loops, create variables of different data types, and manipulate strings. It is worth noting that all of these are possible in assembly or machine language, but high-level languages make them much easier for the programmer to read, write, and debug. Some newer high-level languages are scripting languages. This means that they are not compiled, or translated into machine language, until just before the code is executed at runtime. Python, SQL, Java, Javascript, PHP, Ruby, and Bash are all scripting languages.</td>
