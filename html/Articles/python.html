        <h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
        <p>
          The Python programming language is a general-purpose, interactive, object-oriented, high-level programming language. This language was created by the scientist Judy van Wisem between 1985-1990. As with the Perl programming language, the Python source code is available to the Government of the National Union (GNU) as a public certificate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Open source and scalable. Python is a multi-purpose interpretive language and is widely used in many fields, such as building stand-alone programs using well-known graphical interfaces and in making web programs, in addition to using it as a scripting language to control the performance of some of the most well-known programs or to build extensions to them. In general, Python can be used to program simple programs for beginners and to complete huge projects like any other programming language at the same time. Beginners in the field of programming are often advised to learn this language because it is among the fastest learned programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python originated at the CWI Center (Center for Science and Computer) in Amsterdam by Guido Van Rossum in the late eighties of the last century, and it was first announced in 1991. The kernel of the language was written in C. Van Rossum called his language "Python" as an expression of His admiration for a famous sitcom from Britain, which called itself Monty Python.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python is distinguished by its active community, and it also has many special-purpose programming libraries programmed by people from the community of this language, for example the PyGame library, which provides a set of functions for programming games. Python can handle many types of databases such as MySQL and others.

      <div id="history">
        <h3><b>History</b></h3>
        <p>
          Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling (from the start plus new capabilities in Python 3.11) and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's "benevolent dictator for life", a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker. In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features. Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.
          </li>
          <li>
            Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3. No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it. Currently only 3.7 and later are supported. In 2021, Python 3.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited as all versions of Python (including 2.7) had security issues leading to possible remote code execution and web cache poisoning.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited and 3.8.13, and 3.7.13, because of many security issues. When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) will only receive security fixes going forward. On September 7, 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.
          </li>
          <li>
            As of November 2022, Python 3.11.0 is the current stable release and among the notable changes from 3.10 are that it is 10–60% faster and significantly improved error reporting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Python 3.12 (alpha 2) has improved error messages.
          </li>

        <h3><b>Uses</b></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Python can serve as a scripting language for web applications, e.g., via mod_wsgi for the Apache webserver. With Web Server Gateway Interface, a standard API has evolved to facilitate these applications. Web frameworks like Django, Pylons, Pyramid, TurboGears, web2py, Tornado, Flask, Bottle, and Zope support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications. Pyjs and IronPython can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based applications. SQLAlchemy can be used as a data mapper to a relational database. Twisted is a framework to program communications between computers, and is used (for example) by Dropbox.
          </li>
          <li>
            Libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib allow the effective use of Python in scientific computing, with specialized libraries such as Biopython and Astropy providing domain-specific functionality. SageMath is a computer algebra system with a notebook interface programmable in Python: its library covers many aspects of mathematics, including algebra, combinatorics, numerical mathematics, number theory, and calculus. OpenCV has Python bindings with a rich set of features for computer vision and image processing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Python is commonly used in artificial intelligence projects and machine learning projects with the help of libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, Pytorch, and Scikit-learn. As a scripting language with a modular architecture, simple syntax, and rich text processing tools, Python is often used for natural language processing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Python can also be used to create games, with libraries such as Pygame, which can make 2D games.
          </li>
          <li>
            Python has been successfully embedded in many software products as a scripting language, including in finite element method software such as Abaqus, 3D parametric modelers like FreeCAD, 3D animation packages such as 3ds Max, Blender, Cinema 4D, Lightwave, Houdini, Maya, modo, MotionBuilder, Softimage, the visual effects compositor Nuke, 2D imaging programs like GIMP, Inkscape, Scribus and Paint Shop Pro, and musical notation programs like scorewriter and capella. GNU Debugger uses Python as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as C++ containers. Esri promotes Python as the best choice for writing scripts in ArcGIS. It has also been used in several video games, and has been adopted as first of the three available programming languages in Google App Engine, the other two being Java and Go.
          </li>
          <li>
            Many operating systems include Python as a standard component. It ships with most Linux distributions, AmigaOS 4 (using Python 2.7), FreeBSD (as a package), NetBSD, and OpenBSD (as a package) and can be used from the command line (terminal). Many Linux distributions use installers written in Python: Ubuntu uses the Ubiquity installer, while Red Hat Linux and Fedora Linux use the Anaconda installer. Gentoo Linux uses Python in its package management system, Portage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Python is used extensively in the information security industry, including in exploit development.
          </li>
          <li>
            Most of the Sugar software for the One Laptop per Child XO, developed at Sugar Labs since 2008, is written in Python. The Raspberry Pi single-board computer project has adopted Python as its main user-programming language.
          </li>
          <li>
            LibreOffice includes Python and intends to replace Java with Python. Its Python Scripting Provider is a core feature since Version 4.
